<h2>UltraBac Targets VMware</h2>
<p>The latest release of UltraBac Software's UBDR Gold software includes an option that can create a VMware Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) file while capturing a live system snapshot backup. This simplifies disaster recovery by eliminating the conversion required by a typical physical-to-virtual (P2V) operation. Administrators only need to create a "standby" virtual machine and then set it up to receive the VMDK backup file from the physical production server's daily backups.</p>
