<h2>New releases of UltraBac and UBDR Gold backup and disaster recovery software strengthen virtualization, consolidation, and data management capabilities.</h2>
<p><b>Bellevue, Wash. - (May 20, 2009)</b> - UltraBac Software (www.ultrabac.com) today announced major new releases of their UltraBac and UBDR Gold backup and disaster recovery software. UBDR Gold Version 5.0 now has the ability to create VMware&#174; ESX or GSX Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) files in one simultaneous operation while backing up a live system. Creating ESX and GSX VMDK files during a regular Windows image backup is a first in the industry. This greatly simplifies a disaster recovery by eliminating the conversion required by a typical physical-to-virtual (P2V) operation. UltraBac Version 9.0 introduces a brand new Management Console along with an innovative VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) Agent.</p>
<p>UltraBac Version 9.0 continues to provide the same great data protection features and functionality, but has been completely redesigned with a new UltraBac Management Console. The fresh user interface, based on a tabular format similar to Microsoft’s Office 2007, makes the software more intuitive and easier to use than ever. Version 9.0 also supports SQL Server 2008, Sharepoint 2007, and introduces a new VCB Agent.</p>
<p>The VCB Agent provides VMware users a centralized backup solution for all guest machines – it does not require software to be installed locally. Utilizing VMware's snapshot technology ensures that the system is backed up in a clean state. Administrators can select either a FileVM or FullVM backup operation. Users have the ability to choose which virtual machines (VMs) to back up while performing a FullVM. For an extra level of granularity, users can also select which machines, files, and folders to back up when performing a FileVM. FileVM backups can be restored back to the original machine or to an alternate location.</p>
<p>"As organizations look to decrease costs, virtualization is becoming a larger factor when considering a backup solution," says Dave Russell, Research Vice President from Gartner.</p>
<p>Recognizing the continuing rapid growth in the virtualization market, the VCB Agent was also created with consumer cost savings in mind. Due to the nature of the technology, not only will the burden on protected virtual machines be minimized, but it will do so at a very affordable price when compared to dedicated VCB backup products. Dedicated products provide limited functionality when compared to UltraBac v9.0, a fully featured solution.</p>
<p>UBDR Gold Version 5.0 allows an administrator to generate a single Windows image backup job that will also concurrently create either an ESX VMDK file or a GSX VMDK file. The P2V operation can take less than three minutes after the backup completes because no additional processing is required.</p>
<p>Another unique feature is subsequent differential and incremental backups will automatically update the base VMDK file when performed to a UNC share path. This produces up-to-date data for any required P2V operation. With a virtual machine on standby, an administrator would simply need to upload the VMDK file and boot to perform a complete disaster recovery operation. All disks, partitions, and file types found in VMware user environments are supported. Thus, UBDR Gold v5.0 eliminates conversion issues because a VMDK file can be universally read as if it were a physical disk. As a side benefit, UBDR Gold's VMDK file backups can also help promote green data center initiatives since multiple virtual machines can reside on one physical disk, or host, for disaster recovery failover.</p>
<p>"I am very proud to be able to announce yet another first for UltraBac Software," said Morgan Edwards, CEO and founder of UltraBac Software. "The ability to create native VMDK files in one simultaneous operation during a regular image backup is unique. With this addition, UBDR Gold delivers a significant and technologically advanced virtual migration and disaster recovery feature for the VMware virtual user community. As a VMware Select Partner, we've aspired to stay at the forefront of virtual data protection. This new functionality truly makes virtual disaster recovery effortless and cost effective."</p>
<p>UBDR Gold Version 5.0 and UltraBac Version 9.0 are available now. Pricing is USD $995 for the UBDR Gold Server Edition, which includes all virtual and dissimilar hardware restore capabilities. The UltraBac Server Edition is priced at $495 and $1,095 for the UltraBac Enterprise Edition; volume licensing discounts are available. The new VCB Agent is priced at $495 per socket.</p>
