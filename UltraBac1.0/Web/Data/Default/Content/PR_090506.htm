<h2>New SBS Bundles deliver affordable disaster recovery protection and added features for Microsoft Small Business Server users.</h2>
<p><b>Bellevue, Wash. - (May 6, 2009)</b> - UltraBac Software (www.ultrabac.com) today announced its expansion of the UltraBac product line with the release of two new Small Business Server Bundles. These software offerings represent the shift in needs of the small business owner, as well as fulfill UltraBac Software's continued goal to provide robust and affordable solutions to those organizations running Microsoft Small Business Server. UltraBac Standard SBS Bundle and UltraBac Premium SBS Bundle provide standard file-by-file backup along with the ability to perform image bare metal disaster recovery to dissimilar hardware and virtual machines. In an effort to further assist this key market, a full year of technical support and update protection is also included with each product for a truly comprehensive solution.</p>
<p>By bundling file-by-file backup with bare metal disaster recovery users can recover a complete system in a matter of minutes. These products include the ability to restore the image of a failed SBS server to a wide variety of drives, controllers, and virtual machines (such as VMware or Microsoft Hyper-V). This combination of features also allows users to easily handle system migrations.</p>
<p>The UltraBac Standard SBS Bundle includes protection for Exchange, SharePoint, and exclusive locked files. The solution not only protects the server, but up to 100 Windows clients. UltraBac Premium SBS Bundle expands on this offering by providing the SQL component many small businesses require in today's network environments. Both products have been specifically tailored to Microsoft Small Business Server users to offer world-class backup and recovery, virtualization, and migration tools at the most affordable prices.</p>
<p>"We recognize the strength of the small business community and continually strive to provide them with the features their unique environments require," said Morgan Edwards, CEO. "It is not financially feasible for every small business to have a full IT staff, let alone even one full time Network Administrator. Our industry should not expect these companies to have the manpower to invest hours in learning best practices of data protection – it is our job to provide it. Our software is designed to easily install and recover reliably right out of the box. Unlike some of our competitors who require the purchase of support and maintenance with their small business products, UltraBac Software does not have this requirement. We don’t believe in the illusion of low pricing and then tacking on extra fees on the back end. Small businesses don’t need these headaches. UltraBac Software believes in being as straightforward and upfront as our products are."</p>
<p>The UltraBac Standard SBS Bundle and UltraBac Premium SBS Bundle are available now. Pricing is USD $695 for the standard edition and $895 for the premium edition. UltraBac Software's industry leading technical support and maintenance are included in the purchase price for the first year.</p>
