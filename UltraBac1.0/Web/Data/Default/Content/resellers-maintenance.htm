<p>An UltraBac Maintenance and Support Contract (MSC) is a valuable addition to any product purchase. These contracts entitle your customers to priority response, unlimited first class technical support, and software upgrades at no charge. With the purchase of an MSC, the customer does not run the risk of expensive per incident rates or having to pay for new feature software upgrades.</p>
<p>Extra profits can be made every year by selling annual MSC’s to your customers. Ideally, maintenance should be sold at the time of the product sale, but it is available for resale at any time. As a free service to our resellers participating in the UltraBac Software Maintenance Program, we check our records periodically and alert you regarding the status of your accounts. We assist our resellers in keeping up with their customers' maintenance renewals – adding the possibility of a steady revenue stream. Don't overlook this important advantage of becoming part of the UltraBac Software Partner Program.</p>
