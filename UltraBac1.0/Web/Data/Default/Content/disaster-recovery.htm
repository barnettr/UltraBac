<p><b>UBDR Pro is the first level of defense in Windows disaster recovery.</b> Many disaster recovery products use image or snapshot technology, but can they perform a bare metal restore in the event of an unrecoverable machine? UBDR Pro can, in as little as 15 minutes.</p>
<p>To recover a failed server, a user need only insert the UBDR Pro CD, boot the machine, and start the wizard to initiate a restore with just a few clicks of the mouse. No additional steps are required. After restoring the image backup, the server is recovered to the state it was in when the backup was started. UBDR Pro also offers built-in encryption so users can fully comply with security requirements for backup media stored either on or off-site. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class=arrowLink title="UBDR Pro Overview" href="~/category.aspx?cid=105">More</a></p>
<p><b>UBDR Gold provides customers the same great features as UBDR Pro, but with more features and options to satisfy the needs of even the largest corporation.</b> With the ability to cold boot a machine, users can perform image or file based backups to literally every type of storage device: SAN, NAS, UNC path, local disk, TSM*, SFTP/FTP*, local/remote tape devices, and media libraries. UBDR Gold differs significantly from Pro by not only providing optional agents* for TSM, SFTP/FTP, CIP, and VMDK, but by giving users the ability to perform dissimilar hardware restores. Virtual migrations and disaster recoveries are also made simple utilizing UBDR Gold. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a class=arrowLink title="UBDR Gold Overview" href="~/category.aspx?cid=95">More</a></p>
<p>UBDR Pro and Gold use UltraBac's ability to perform image backups, along with a Windows based universal boot CD environment, to restore one or more disk partitions even when no operating system is available. These disaster recovery products can be licensed for independent, stand-alone use, or it can be fully integrated with UltraBac's regular file-by-file backup and restore software.</p>
