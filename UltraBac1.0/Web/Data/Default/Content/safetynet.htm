<p><b>UltraBac Software's design philosophy is that backup must be a safety net for the data that is the lifeblood of a business.</b> Our products are designed with this in mind to reduce or eliminate backup failures, so that when hardware fails, data is safe.</p>
<p>Our safety-net design incorporates strategic features like built-in media cascading, hardware failure redirect, tape duplication capability, email alerts &amp; notifications, and bare metal disaster recovery:</p>
<ul class="bullet bulletFlush">
<li><span class="bulletFontColor"><b>Media cascading</b> automatically spans media when a backup becomes too large.</span></li>
<li><span class="bulletFontColor"><b>Hardware failure redirect</b> automatically restarts a failed backup to a designated alternative drive or UNC path.</span></li>
<li><span class="bulletFontColor"><b>UltraCopy tape duplication</b> option allows for an off-site backup tape to be created after a regular backup completes and/or allows conversion of media (e.g. tape to tape, tape to disk, &amp; vice versa).</span></li>
<li><span class="bulletFontColor"><b>Pre-backup status check</b> automatically sends an email alert before a scheduled backup is to begin if no media is in the drive or if the media is date-protected.</span></li>
<li><span class="bulletFontColor"><b>Automatically-triggered administrator alerts</b> facilitate corrective action for specific backup failure conditions.</span></li>
<li><span class="bulletFontColor"><b>Bare metal disaster recovery</b> complements standard UltraBac file-by-file backups by providing users with the fastest and simplest technology for recovering a dead machine. Users can perform dissimilar hardware restores and virtual recoveries.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title="Product Overview" href="~/content.aspx?page=disaster-recovery">More on UltraBac Disaster Recovery (UBDR)...</a></span></li></ul>
