<p><b>Store Backups as VMDKs</b></p>
<p>The latest release of UltraBac Software's UltraBac and UBDR backup and disaster recovery products can create VMware ESX or GSX Virtual Machine Disk, or VMDK, files at the same time as a regular Windows image backup. Available in UBDR 5.0 Gold, this feature eliminates the need for a physical-to-virtual conversion during disaster recovery. In addition, UltraBac 9.0 also gets a new management console and a VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) agent that uses VMware's snapshot technology to ensure a clean backup of a virtual machine.</p>
<p>UBDR Gold Version 5.0 and UltraBac Version 9.0 are available now. UBDR Gold Server Edition costs $995, while UltraBac Server Edition starts at $495. The new VCB agent is $495 per socket.</p>
