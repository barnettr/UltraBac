<h2>Featuring Bare Metal Restore for both x64 &amp; IA64 Systems and Continuous Image Protection</h2>
<p><b>Bellevue, Wash. – (July 17, 2008)</b> – UltraBac Software (www.ultrabac.com) today announced the availability of UltraBac version 8.3 and UBDR Gold version 4.0 with vast enhancements for enterprises with 64-bit systems and those in need of image-based Continuous Data Protection (CDP). Both products have received certification for Vista and Windows 2008.</p>
<p>UBDR Gold v4.0 is the first-known backup and recovery solution to offer dissimilar hardware bare metal restores for both x64 and IA64 processor based systems. The support, originally available in a limited November release, has been fine tuned to provide administrators with hassle free upgrades for disaster recovery and the data center.</p>
<p>The company also announced a new image-based CDP option that UltraBac Software has dubbed Continuous Image Protection (CIP)&#8482;. CIP enables UltraBac Software's image-based disaster recovery solution, UBDR Gold, to recover to a 'point-in-time' that can be as recent as just a few minutes versus the restoration of a standard image backup where the data can be up to 24 hours old.</p>
<p>"The updates in UBDR Gold v4.0 and UltraBac v8.3 further the goal at the center of our business – maximum uptime for our customers," said Morgan Edwards, founder and CEO of UltraBac Software. "We've invested significant time and resources to offer solutions that ensure that our customers have the fastest, most reliable access to stored data, avoiding costly downtime while waiting for failed machines to be recovered."</p>
<p><b>Continuous Image Protection – As close to real-time recovery as it gets</b><br />CIP can be of significant benefit to any organization that may have the need to restore a system or partition to a selected point-in-time rather than the last full, incremental, or differential snapshot. Many organizations, including retail and financial businesses, have data that changes rapidly. Also, with an increase in virtual machines, such as VMware ESX Server and Citrix XenServer, more and more organizations are relying on image-based backups which offer much quicker recovery time than traditional file-by-file backups. When recoveries are required on these mission critical systems, organizations need data restores to be as close to real-time as possible.</p>
<p>UBDR Gold's new CIP functionality answers this need by offering an advanced form of image backup and recovery. It first performs a full image backup and then creates a never-ending differential that runs until terminated, or until another CIP backup is initiated.</p>
<p>"We have staked our business on the reliability that UltraBac Software has offered in its dependable solutions," said Steve Robinson, VP of Technical Operations for GramTel, which develops data centers as well as provides disaster recovery and business continuity services. "Many of our customers have requested a cost-effective continuous data protection option. The new continuous image protection features in UBDR Gold v4.0 will provide us such an option."</p>
<p><b>Availability</b><br />UltraBac v8.3 and UBDR Gold v4.0 are available now. During CIP’s introductory period, this new feature will be free with the purchase of UBDR Gold v4.0. Customers on maintenance will also be provided a free upgrade from their existing UBDR Gold v3.x software.</p>
