<h2>Providing the Ability to Simultaneously Create VMDK Files for Disaster Recovery while Backing Up a Live System</h2>
<p><b>Las Vegas, Nev. and Bellevue, Wash. – (September 18, 2008)</b> – UltraBac Software announced UBDR Gold's ability to create VMware ESX and/or GSX Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) files in one simultaneous operation while backing up a live system. Creating ESX and GSX VMDK files during a regular image backup is a first in the industry. This greatly simplifies a disaster recovery by eliminating the conversion required by a typical physical-to-virtual (P2V) operation. This new functionality will be launched, along with a user friendly VMware Consolidated Backup (VCB) Agent, in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Utilizing UBDR Gold, an administrator can create a single backup job for an image file, an ESX VMDK file, and/or a GSX VMDK file. If VMDK files are chosen, they can be automatically uploaded via a set's backup path. Since a VMDK file has already been created by a backup, a P2V disaster recovery operation can be performed in the absolute minimum of time. The VMDK files generated by a physical server's UBDR Gold backups can be directly uploaded so they can be used immediately to boot when required. Another unique feature of this solution is that both differential and incremental backups can automatically update the base VMDK file so it is always up-to-date for any required P2V operation. To minimize disaster recovery time, an administrator would just create this "standby" virtual machine.</p>
<p>When a UBDR Gold protected server fails, an operator will now have two disaster recovery options: quickly recover the physical server using UBDR Gold's image-based disaster recovery capability, or recover the failed server virtually for an even faster means of bringing the machine back online. To complete a virtual recovery, a user would only need to power up the standby virtual machine. This new functionality will empower a VMware administrator to inexpensively meet or surpass system uptime requirements by providing a directly mountable disaster recovery solution that is simply part of the daily backup regime.</p>
<p>Before this announcement, performing a P2V operation required a number of steps, during which a conversion could be easily thwarted because not every solution supports every combination of disk or partition type found in end-user environments. UBDR Gold requires no conversion, or additional time spent, because a .vmdk file is created as part of a regular backup. UBDR Gold VMDK file backups can be written to all disk types (Basic, Dynamic, and GPT), all partition types (Primary, Extended, Logical, and Simple volumes), and all Windows file system types (FAT16/32, NTFS, and EISA). This offers great flexibility and literally eliminates P2V conversions as they were previously known, making system protection inherently more reliable since a .vmdk file can be universally read as if it were a physical disk. As a side benefit, storing system backups virtually can help promote green data center initiatives since multiple virtual machines can reside on one physical disk.</p>
<p>"We're proud to continue our track record of providing first to market backup and disaster recovery features for the virtual market space," said Morgan Edwards, CEO and founder of UltraBac Software. "As a VMware Select Partner, we've aspired to create an always-ready-to-go P2V disaster recovery solution simply powered through daily UBDR Gold backups. I think our customers will particularly appreciate our development team's work in figuring out how to update a VMDK file with daily differential or incremental backups. With this new functionality, the only time it will take to start and finish a P2V based disaster recovery is the time it takes to bring a virtual machine online. It truly is an effortless disaster recovery process that is affordable as well."</p>
<p><b>Availability</b><br />UBDR Gold v4.0, with support for VMware, including P2V, P2P, V2P, and V2V features, is shipping now. The new VMDK functionality and Virtual Consolidated Backup Agent will be available Q4 2008.</p>
