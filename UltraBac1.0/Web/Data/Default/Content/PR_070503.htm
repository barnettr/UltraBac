<h2>Added Support for Microsoft SharePoint Now Enables Backup and Recovery of Multiple Data Layers</h2>
<p><b>Bellevue, Wash. – (May 3, 2007)</b> – UltraBac Software (www.ultrabac.com) today announced the release of UltraBac version 8.2 with major enhancements, including file-by-file backup support for Volume Shadow Copy Service, Secure FTP (SFTP), and a brand new SharePoint Server Agent.</p>
<p>The UltraBac SharePoint Server Agent enables organizations running SharePoint to incorporate seamless backup and recovery within multiple layers of collaborative data. The agent's approach is reflective of the architecture in SharePoint itself by allowing multiple copies and versioning of files and public sharing of files in an organized manner.</p>
<p>To better protect user information, the UltraBac FTP Device has added functionality. SFTP is supported so that all information transferred over the internet to the FTP device is encrypted, rather than just the backup sets themselves.</p>
<p>UltraBac v8.2 also provides an option for file-by-file backup customers to use Microsoft's Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) to safely freeze open files for backup, in lieu of the proprietary UltraBac Locked File Backup Agent. VSS is a user selectable option for file-by-file backups on both 32 and 64-bit machines.</p>
<p>"The release of UltraBac Version 8.2 adds even more flexibility and versatility to our backup and recovery offerings," said Paul Bunn, CTO of UltraBac Software. "The new SharePoint Server Agent was developed in response to the increasing popularity for this collaborative solution. We've also added file-by-file support for VSS as an additional backup option to use Microsoft's volume snapshot functionality."</p>
<p>Further features and functionality have also been added in UltraBac v8.2, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced graphical user interface with increased scheduling views, streamlined toolbars, and log file handling.</li>
<li>Automated cleaning options for tape libraries.</li>
<li>Extended UltraCopy features including library/media pool support, device support verification, and speed enhancements when restoring from UltraCopy.</li></ul>
<p>With the release of v8.2, UltraBac Software also reiterated that UltraBac products natively support both 32 and 64-bit systems. Even though native 64-bit versions have been available from the company for nearly two years, UltraBac Software reports that enterprise-level customer demand for 64-bit support has recently increased significantly after what was initially a very slow start.</p>
<p>Pricing starts from US$495 per server with the ability to back up an unlimited number of workstations. Additional specific agents, which are available to further customize an UltraBac installation, include UBDR Gold and Pro, Exchange, SQL Server, Locked File Backup, SharePoint, Oracle, UNIX, NetWare, FTP, Tivoli Storage Manager, and a Media Library Module.</p>
