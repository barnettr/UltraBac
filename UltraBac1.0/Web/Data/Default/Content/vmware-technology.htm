<h2>UBDR Gold supports P2V, V2V, and V2P backups, migrations, and restores</h2>

<p>Bellevue, Wash. and San Francisco, Calif. - VMworld – Booth #434 - (September 10, 2007) - UltraBac Software announced today that it has joined the VMware Technology Alliance Partner Program. The partnership was initiated in response to UBDR Gold’s ability to facilitate P2V, V2V, and V2P image-based backups, as well as migrate and restore to virtual and physical servers. The new alliance fits well with VMware’s desire to build and strengthen relationships with customers by helping them recognize compatible solutions which enhance the use of their products.</p>

<p>UltraBac Software will be exhibiting at VMworld in San Francisco this week, and staff will be on hand to discuss the first-to-market P2V disaster recovery solution with VMware customers and prospects. UBDR Gold allows users to perform a physical-to-virtual recovery by simply creating as many new virtual environments as required on a host virtual server. Then the software is used to boot into the recovery wizard. The recovery to the virtual environment is automatic and requires no special setup, pre-configuration, or other considerations. UBDR Gold will be demonstrated at booth 434, and is located nearly adjacent to VMware’s display.</p>

<p>“UBDR Gold offers organizations running virtual servers the ultimate flexibility in the migration of data to and from virtual and physical servers,” said Paul Bunn, CTO of UltraBac Software. “It no longer matters if your data is on a physical machine or a virtual one. UBDR Gold has native support for backing up, migrating to, or restoring to any media, regardless of type or partition size.”</p>

<p>UBDR Gold can perform full “bare metal” restores of failed servers at rates of up to 6GB per minute. Users have the ability to specify drivers during both the boot and restore processes, and can restore partitions that are larger or smaller than the original. The solution is used by organizations worldwide to backup, migrate, and restore data at lighting fast speeds. UltraBac Software solutions support backups and recoveries to dissimilar media of practically any type, as well as virtual machines.</p>
