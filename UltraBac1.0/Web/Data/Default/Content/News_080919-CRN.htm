<h2>UltraBac Simplifies VMware Virtual Machine Disaster Recovery</h2>
<p>UltraBac Software, Bellevue, Wash., introduced a new option to create a VMware Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) file while capturing a live system snapshot backup as part of its UltraBac Disaster Recovery (UBDR) Gold application.</p>
<p>That new option simplifies disaster recovery by eliminating the need to for a separate step to convert data to a VMDK conversion when doing a physical-to-virtual data migration.</p>
<p>When data is backed up and converted to a VMDK, it is available to administrators for fast recovery in case of a disaster in one of two ways: either to recover to a physical server using UBDR Gold's image-based disaster recovery capability, or recover to a stand-by virtual server.</p>
<p>UBDR Gold v4.0, with support for VMware, is currently shipping. The new direct write to VMDK feature is expected by be available by year-end.</p>
