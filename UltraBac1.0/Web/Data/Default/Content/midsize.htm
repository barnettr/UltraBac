<p>It can be tough transitioning from the "little guy" to competing against the "500 lb gorillas." Do you even remember what your core business is these days or are you spending more and more of your time dealing with IT issues?</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on the critical functions of growing your business (investing in areas like R&amp;D, marketing, and staffing), you may be more worried about keeping up with the latest government regulations for storing data and terrified thinking of the ramifications of a complete data loss. Worry no moreâ€”UltraBac Software relieves that stress by protecting and securing your data so you can focus on your ever growing business.</p>
<p>It may seem daunting to manage a backup and disaster recovery program for your company, but we can make the process appear transparent. Our UltraBac and UBDR products cover all your backup and disaster recovery needs with comprehensive and easy-to-use solutions. We can also grow with you, providing additional licenses and agent options rather than requiring you to invest in a completely new software suite if you expand toward the enterprise business level.</p>
<p>Allow us to help you minimize your exposure and risk. Whether you require live image backups, bare metal restores, virtual machine boot options, restores to dissimilar hardware, etc., UltraBac Software is here to support you.</p>
<p>Has your current backup or disaster recovery provider ever incorporated your feedback or specific business needs into their products? We have done just that for some of our customers. Understanding all businesses are different is one thing, but actually treating them as such is something only we do.</p>
<p>UltraBac Software is also widely recognized for our industry leading technical support. This staff resides in-house and works closely with our development and sales teams to provide a build-to-deliver understanding of all of our products, which translates into quick and accurate service to you. We want to use our years of expertise to protect your data so you can focus on continuing to grow your business.</p><!-- Case Studies -->
