<h2>Innovative Method Speeds Recovery and Offers Greater Flexibility</h2>
<p><b>Bellevue, Wash. – (Sept. 27, 2006)</b> – UltraBac Software (www.ultrabac.com) today announced the delivery of a bootable USB flash drive recovery option for UBDR Gold, the company's leading edge image-based disaster recovery software.</p>
<p>UBDR Gold now provides yet another user-friendly boot and restore media option. This adds to the already extensive array of existing recovery options that include local tape and disk, remote tape and disk, local and remote libraries, SAN, NAS, FTP devices, and TSM servers. UBDR Gold users now have alternative forms of media to perform a bare metal disaster recovery. In as little as three minutes, the UBDR Gold USB Flash Drive option can restore the image of a failed server to a wide variety of drives, controllers, and virtual machines (such as VMware or Microsoft Virtual Server).</p>
<p>UltraBac Software's disaster recovery solution, UBDR Gold with flash drive, does all the work for you. To recover a failed machine simply connect and boot from the USB drive, run the restore wizard, and initiate the restore with just a few clicks of the mouse. With the UBDR Gold USB Flash Drive option boot time is reduced by over 75 percent compared to booting from a CD, and the auto-restore information can be easily modified to allow fully 100 percent scripted restores.</p>
<p>"Flexibility and speed are crucial when you're restoring a mission critical server in the midst of a disaster," said Paul Bunn, CTO of UltraBac Software. "We've developed a reputation for delivering backup and recovery solutions that are flexible, innovative, and lightning fast. The availability of UBDR Gold Flash Drive restore functionality continues this tradition."</p>
<p>Recovering a failed server in 15 minutes from a boot CD is fast, but speed is increased using a USB flash drive, making the recovery time as little as three minutes. Not only is recovering with USB flash drivers faster, but this media is also small and robust. Best of all they can also be updated to add new device drivers and versions of the software as they become available.</p>
<p>Pricing for UBDR Gold with the USB flash drive feature starts at US$1045 per server.</p>
