<h2>UltraBac: Continuous Data Protection for IA64</h2>
<p>UltraBac Software recently released the 8.3 version of its UltraBac backup/recovery software, as well as UBDR Gold version 4.0, both of which are certified for Vista and Windows 2008. The UBDR Gold 4.0 backup-and-recovery software enables dissimilar bare metal restores for both x64 and IA64-based systems. UltraBac also introduced an image-based continuous data protection (CDP) option, dubbed Continuous Image Protection (CIP), for UBDR Gold. CIP enables UBDR to recover a point in time that can be as recent as a few minutes, as opposed to the restoration of a standard image backup where the data can be up to 24 hours old.</p>
