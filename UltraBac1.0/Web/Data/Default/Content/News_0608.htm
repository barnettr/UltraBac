<p>The 8.1 version of the UltraBac backup software includes an enhanced user interface, expanded media library support, and ease-of-use features. The interface includes a "Future" pane in the built-in scheduler that allows users to view and edit backup jobs, as well as a "history" pane that allows users to query backup logs for specific types of backups (e.g., by date range, host, etc.).</p>
<p>The optional UltraCopy cost agent now supports media spanning in tape autoloaders and libraries. UltraCopy is typically used for implementing off-site disaster-recovery plans and is a two-stage utility for either disk-to-tape or tape-to-tape backup operations.</p>
<p>Other new features in UltraBac 8.1 include embedded HTTP help links in backup logs, auto detection and reporting of mismatched UltraBac programme filer versions, "eject-and-restore" functionality, and support for CD/DVD drives and Iomega's REV autoloader. Pricing starts at US$495 per server.</p>
