<h2>UBDR Gold is the first bare-metal recovery utility that has integrated FTP into disaster recovery.</h2>
<p>UltraBac UBDR Gold Server edition v3.5 is priced $995 with agents for TSM, FTP, and media libraries available for an additional cost. After the product is purchased, you can arrange to receive it in a download, if so desired. Technical support is free during the evaluation period or with a maintenance contract; without a maintenance contract, the company charges a per-incident fee.</p>
<p>Both UBDR Pro and UBDR Gold are on bootable CDs that use Windows PE technology as a platform to perform UltraBac Image Disaster Recovery Agent restorations. UBDR Pro is designed to retrieve and restore UltraBac image backups of a partition or an entire disk from a locally attached tape device or a remote disk path. UBDR Gold also has that ability, as well as the option to restore from an FTP site, Tivoli device, or a remote tape device. UBDR Gold can also be used to perform both image and file-by-file backups. When the system boots, the UBDR Restore CD automatically detects and loads drivers for most NIC cards, SCSI cards, and RAID controllers.</p>
<p>UBDR Gold can coexist with any backup solution as a standalone license or it can be integrated with an existing UltraBac backup license. The UBDR Gold Stand-Alone version includes a backup software engine. This option is slightly more expensive, but UBDR Gold Stand-Alone offers true machine-backup redundancy and provides access to a licensed machine's tape drive remotely when installed.</p>
