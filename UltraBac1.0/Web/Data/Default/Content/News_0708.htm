<h2>UltraBac Upgrades UBDR Software</h2>
<p>The 3.5 version of UltraBac Software's UBDR Gold backup and disaster-recovery software includes the ability to restore to partitions of any size (regardless of the original's size) and enables users to specify drivers during both the boot and restore processes.</p>
<p>For example, users can restore the backup of a 200GB disk to a 160GB disk. UBDR automatically records and displays the original media's key information, including disk and partition size, in each backup set. In addition, administrators can specify a new or alternate driver during the disaster-recovery restore process, which can be advantageous when restoring to dissimilar hardware. The UBDR Gold is priced from $995 per server.</p>
