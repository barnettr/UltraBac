<h2><a name="Do I">Do I need a license?</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are requesting a permanent license for version 7.x, 8.x, or 9.x please ensure that your accounting department has submitted payment for the software in advance. Permanent licenses are only issued after your invoice has been paid.</p>
<p>You need to fill out the <a title="License Request Form" href="~/content.aspx?page=licensing-form">Online Registration Page</a> here if:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have paid for UltraBac software and have not yet received a permanent license.</li>
<li>Your evaluation license is about to expire and you need more time to evaluate UltraBac.</li></ol>
<p>UltraBac trial software, whether downloaded or on CD, are 20-day temporary evaluation licenses. At the end of this 20 day period the software will expire to 'Restore-Mode Only.'</p>

<h2><a name="What type">What type of license do I need?</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two main classes of licenses:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Permanent</b>. These licenses are to be based on a specific computer name. <i>These licenses are only issued after your invoice has been paid.</i></li>
<li><b>Temporary</b>. These licenses are typically issued as the UltraBac Enterprise Edition with all of the Agents (Exchange, SQL, etc.) enabled. If you need to evaluate the image restore capabilities of UBDR Pro or UBDR Gold, the restore CDs are issued separately. Request a UBDR CD <a title="UBDR Restore CD Request" href="~/content.aspx?page=ubdr-request">here</a>.<br />All temporary licenses are issued for a period of 20 days. These licenses will need to be approved by the sales representative that you have been speaking with. If you feel you need longer than the standard 20 days, please explain your reasons for this in the "Comments" section of the <a title="License Request Form" href="~/content.aspx?page=licensing-form">Online Registration Page</a>.</li></ol>
