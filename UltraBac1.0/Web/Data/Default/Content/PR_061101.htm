<h2>UltraBac Software Ranked as One of the World's Largest Software Companies</h2>
<p><b>Bellevue, Wash. – (November 1, 2006)</b> – UltraBac Software (www.ultrabac.com) today announced its inclusion on the Software 500, Software Magazine's list of the world's foremost software and services providers. This is the ninth year in a row UltraBac Software has been honored for its continued growth and sales revenues in the competitive backup and disaster recovery solutions market.</p>
<p>"Strong segments this year included security and system integration services. While much of the growth is coming from outside the U.S. in the services segment, the flattening world effect is sending some of it back too," says John P. Desmond, editor of Software Magazine and Softwaremag.com.</p>
<p>"We're pleased to have been named to the Software 500 list again in 2006," said Morgan Edwards, CEO and founder of UltraBac Software. "The report indicates that only 37 percent of the companies on the list are privately owned. Not only is it a great distinction to be among those, but it also speaks volumes to the quality of our products being listed for the ninth straight year."</p>
<p>The Software 500 is a revenue-based ranking of the world's largest software and services suppliers targeting medium to large enterprises, their IT professionals, software developers, and business managers involved in software and services purchasing.</p>
<p>The ranking is based on total worldwide software and services revenue for 2005. This includes revenues from software licenses, maintenance and support, training and software-related services, and consulting. Suppliers are not ranked on their total corporate revenue, since many have other lines of business such as hardware. The financial information was gathered by a survey prepared by King Content Co. and posted at www.Softwaremag.com, as well as from public documents.</p>
