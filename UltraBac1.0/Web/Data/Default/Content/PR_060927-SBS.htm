<h2>New Version Delivers Affordable Image-Based Backup to Microsoft Small Business Server Users</h2>
<p><b>Bellevue, Wash. – (Sept. 27, 2006)</b> – UltraBac Software (www.ultrabac.com) today released UBDR Gold SBS (Small Business Server) Edition, delivering robust and affordable image-based disaster recovery to organizations running Microsoft Small Business Server. UBDR Gold SBS Edition has all the features of its big brother, UBDR Gold, but due to its ability to run only on the SBS platform it is now available at a lower cost for those environments.</p>
<p>UBDR Gold can restore the image of a failed SBS server to a wide variety of drives, controllers, and virtual machines (such as VMware or Microsoft Virtual Server) in as little as five minutes (and typically less than 15 minutes). This unprecedented speed of recovery enables businesses to quickly recover a failed server and resume normal operation at lightning speeds.</p>
<p>UltraBac Software pioneered image backup and disaster recovery in the Windows market place, and has continually been at the forefront in bare metal recovery. They continue to be a leader by providing more backup and disaster recovery options than any other competitive offering. Hardware devices supported include SCSI, RAID, IDE, SATA, as well as PCI and EISA buses. Restoring to a machine with dissimilar hardware or even a different Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) and processor is possible with UBDR Gold SBS Edition.</p>
<p>The backup and recovery media can be virtually any type of storage device or virtual machine. Restores can be 100 percent scripted or an administrator can boot from the universal UBDR Gold SBS Edition media and run the recovery wizard. Quick and easy restores can be performed from tape, disk, libraries, UNC path, SAN, NAS, USB/FireWire devices, FTP, or TSM servers. To restore a server virtually an administrator needs only to create a target environment on the virtual host before the restore is performed.</p>
<p>"With the release of UBDR Gold SBS Edition, we're offering small to medium businesses the same robust, full featured backup and recoveries that our enterprise customers have long enjoyed," said Morgan Edwards, CEO and founder of UltraBac Software. "Organizations running Microsoft SBS now have image-based bare metal restore capability that can incorporate into a strategic disaster recovery plan, at a great price."</p>
<p>Pricing for UBDR Gold SBS Edition v3.0 is priced at US$495 per server.</p>
