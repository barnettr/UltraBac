<h2>MORGAN EDWARDS</h2>
<p><b>Morgan Edwards is President and CEO of UltraBac Software.</b> Trained as a computer systems engineer while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, Mr. Edwards went on to graduate from the University of Washington with a degree in business administration. He worked for Burroughs Corporation, Sperry Univac, and Wang Laboratories before founding BEI Corporation. UltraBac Software's parent company was created in 1982 to develop and market software utility applications for the minicomputer marketplace.</p>
<p>After a decade spent developing and marketing a wide range of products for minicomputers, Mr. Edwards reinvented the company in 1993 when the waning minicomputer user base forced a shift to a new platform. The newly released Windows NT&#174; operating system from Microsoft&#174; became the focus of the company's development efforts, resulting in creation of UltraBac Backup and Disaster Recovery Software for Windows NT/2000. BEI was renamed UltraBac Software to help define and focus development efforts on the Windows platform.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Edwards' leadership, the company has been included in <i>Software Magazine's</i> list of the 500 largest software companies, <i>Puget Sound Business Journal's</i> list of fastest growing private companies, and Deloitte &amp; Touche's Technology Fast 500 and Washington State Technology Fast 50 Award recipients.</p>
