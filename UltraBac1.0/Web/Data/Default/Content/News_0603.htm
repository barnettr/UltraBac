<h2>UltraBac: 'Dissimilar Hardware Restore'</h2>
<p><b>InfoStor</b><br />March 2006</p>
<p>UltraBac Software's UBDR Gold Version 3.0 software eliminates the need for users to buy identical hardware spares for disaster-recovery operations. The Windows-based software can restore to a system with a different hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and processor.</p>
<p>UBDR 3.0 can also be integrated with Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 R2, as well as VMware. In addition to the physical-to-virtual (P2V) disaster recovery provided in UBDR 2.0, the 3.0 version provides virtual-to-virtual (V2V) and virtual-to-physical (V2P) restores. The software also supports restores from Online Indexes. Pricing starts at $995 per server.</p>
