<h2>Award-Winning Disaster Recovery Solution Provides User Interface Updates, Flexible Partition Support, and Additional Dissimilar Device Driver Support</h2>
<p><b>Bellevue, Wash. – (June 5, 2007)</b> – UltraBac Software (www.ultrabac.com) today announced the release of UBDR Gold version 3.5. The update includes user interface revisions; the ability to restore to partitions that are both larger and smaller than the original; and provides the ability for users to specify drivers during both the boot and restore processes.</p>
<p>UBDR Gold v3.5 provides the ability to restore a partition backup to a smaller partition on the target recovery machine. This feature can be relevant in disaster recovery operations where a restore is required to smaller media and/or partitions. For example, users now have the ability to restore the backup of a 200GB disk to a smaller 160GB disk drive. UBDR Gold v3.5 also automatically records and displays the original media's key information, including disk and partition size, in each backup set.</p>
<p>Another key feature of UBDR Gold v3.5 is the flexibility of specifying a new or alternate driver during the disaster recovery restore process. This ability can be critical when restoring to dissimilar hardware, ensuring support for all controller devices used by Windows. Now, rather than having to request an updated boot CD, users can easily specify a required driver whenever necessary without delay. This makes users more self-sufficient and less reliant on software updates for driver support.</p>
<p>The release of UBDR Gold v3.5 is a quick follow-up to last month's upgrade of UltraBac, UltraBac Software's popular backup solution. With version v3.5, UBDR Gold now features the same friendly user interface updates introduced with UltraBac v8.2. Customers familiar with the ease-of-use of UltraBac products will be pleased that this aspect of the software has been further refined with this new version.</p>
<p>"We recognize that companies need easy-to-use software with the right features and functionality to ensure quick restores of failed mission critical machines. During hardware failures clients are under great stress, we help eliminate some of that pressure by providing software that can recover a server in minutes rather than hours or days," said Morgan Edwards, CEO and founder of UltraBac Software. "By allowing a restore to smaller partitions, and the ability to specify alternate device drivers, we've provided complete recovery flexibility. The customer experience has also been enhanced by modifications to the user interface that makes the software even more straightforward. Three years ago users had zero options in the Windows marketplace for disaster recovery to dissimilar hardware or virtual environments. With the release of UBDR Gold v3.5, customers literally now have unlimited capability."</p>
<p>Pricing for UBDR Gold starts at US$995.00 per server.</p>
