<h3>Flexible Licensing</h3>
<p>UltraBac Software offers a flexible, easy to roll-out license for volume purchase commitments. This clear-cut approach to licensing offers significant value when implementing new solutions across an enterprise. The enterprise license can be managed centrally or deployed in a decentralized manner depending on your preference. No matter if you have one or multiple network segments, implementation is straight-forward, simple, and quick.</p>
<h3>Leverage Existing or Future Backup Technology</h3>
<p>UltraBac Software’s image bare metal recovery solution (UBDR Gold) integrates along side your existing traditional backup software. However, for clients who need a comprehensive file and image backup solution, we offer a total solution. This includes both file-based and image-based solutions from the same user interface. Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) customers can further leverage their investment utilizing UBDR Gold – employ TSM as a storage device and directly store UltraBac images to TSM.</p>
<h3>Schedule and Automation</h3>
<p>Set it and forget it. UltraBac Software provides a sophisticated Central Reporting Console that allows organizations to quickly and easily track thousands of backup jobs, as well as cover requirements such as Sarbanes Oxley. Powerful and granular style reporting capabilities are at your fingertips with color coded options for perusing backup jobs, errors, etc. </p>
<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>While not required, an UltraBac Enterprise Technical Account Manager is available for projects which may require on-site consulting. This includes educational and technical workshops, or any on-site services that can aid your organization to realize a successful deployment and a positive project result.</p>
